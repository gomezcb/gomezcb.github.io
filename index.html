				This web page is dedecated to one of my favorite rock bands of all time <em>Nirvana</em>. Their musical genious changed the direction of music and defined a generation.
			</p>
			<p>
				When I first listened to their 2nd studio album <em>Nevermind</em> (1991), I remember being mesmerized by the lyrics and melody that Kurt Cobian gave us. Though his message behind the music was dark at times, he was able to translate his pain into something beautiful.
