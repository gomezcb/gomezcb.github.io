		<p>A heathly diet starts with a single step. It does not have to mean drastic changes all at once, but rather like solving a rubix cube. You take it one piece at a time, one row at a time. You solve enough pieces of the puzzle and before you know it, you have a solution. So take that small step in the right direction and achieve your goal of a healthy diet and lifestyle through the keto diet with me!</p>

		<p>The goal of this site is to help those that are struggling to fight through health issues, or simply just trying to feel better about themselves. Being diagnosed with Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis myself, the feeling of being defeated is only natural. However let me assure you that you are not defeated.</p>
		<p>You have the power to get back up, the power to smile again, and most importantly, the power to believe that things WILL get better. The challenge may be there and the life may change, but you have the power to overcome it.</p>
